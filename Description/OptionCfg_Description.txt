A configuration file can also be used to run ProcDumpEx. In this file parameters for ProcDumpEx can be defined in several lines. Each line is treated like a separate ProcDumpEx process.

Examples:
1.	procdumpex.exe -cfg C:\SampleFile.txt

Sample content of SampleFile.txt:

-ma -w -e -inf -pn "<process 1>.exe, <process 2>.exe“
-ma -e -pn „<PID 1>, <PID 2>“
