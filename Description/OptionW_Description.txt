The '-w' parameter is a parameter used by ProcDump itself. When used in conjunction with ProcDumpEx, it allows ProcDumpEx to detect the termination and restart of a process, and re-open ProcDump instances for the processes found using the '-pn' parameter and process name. This ensures that the desired processes are constantly monitored even after termination and restart.

Example:
1.	ProcDumpEx.exe -ma -w -e -pn "<process 1>.exe, <process 2>.exe“
