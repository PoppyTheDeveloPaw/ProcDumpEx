Since ProcDumpEx starts several ProcDump instances at the same time, the normal output of ProcDump is suppressed and 
only displayed when a ProcDump instance has been started or terminated. With the parameter -showoutput, 
the output of the ProcDump instances is displayed after they have been terminated.

Example:
1.	procdumpex.exe -showoutput -ma -e <process 1.exe>
