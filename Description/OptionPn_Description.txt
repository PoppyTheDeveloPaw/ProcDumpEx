If the parameter '-pn' is used with a process name, ProcDumpEx retrieves the process IDs (PIDs) of all programmes and their corresponding 
subordinate processes with the same name and opens a separate ProcDump instance for each of them. It is also possible to directly specify
the ID of a process instead of its name. In connection with the parameter '-inf', however, this can only be restarted as long as the process with the specified ID exists.
If it is necessary that the PID is inserted at a certain position and not at the end of the arguments, this can be achieved with the placeholder [ProcessPlaceholder].

Example: 
1.	ProcDumpEx.exe -ma -e -pn "<process 1>.exe, <process 2>.exe“
2.	ProcDumpEx.exe -ma -e -pn „<PID 1>, <PID 2>“
3.	ProcDumpEx.exe -ma -e -pn „<PID 1>, <process 2>.exe“
