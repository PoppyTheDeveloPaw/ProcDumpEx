If the parameter '-pn' is used with a process name, ProcDumpEx retrieves the process IDs (PIDs) of all programmes and their corresponding 
subordinate processes with the same name and opens a separate ProcDump instance for each of them. It is also possible to directly specify
the ID of a process instead of its name. In connection with the parameter '-inf', however, this can only be restarted as long as the process with the specified ID exists.
The PID is inserted at the position in the ProcDump command where the process name was specified with -pn. 
If you want it at a different place, you can use the placeholder [ProcessPlaceholder] to specify the place where the PID is inserted.

Example: 
1.	ProcDumpEx.exe -ma -e -pn "<process 1>.exe, <process 2>.exe“
2.	ProcDumpEx.exe -ma -e -pn „<PID 1>, <PID 2>“
3.	ProcDumpEx.exe -ma -e -pn „<PID 1>, <process 2>.exe“
